   2. Non-newtonian fluids (http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2015-01.pdf)
  
2. Detailed cloth simulation from data - take the help of data to produce detailed cloth sims. Can data help with collisions too?
   1. Subspace clothing (http://graphics.pixar.com/library/SubspaceClothing/paper.pdf)
   2. Data-driven clothing (http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2018-03.pdf)

3. Fluid Simulation 
   1. Covector Fluids (SIGGRAPH 2022) - Simulates Euler equations for inviscid fluids by using a novel formulation based on covectors.
   (https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/covectorfluids.pdf)
   2. Unified Particle System for Multiple-fluid Flow and Porous Material (SIGGRAPH 2021) - An SPH-based simulation scheme for multiple-fluid liquid flow interacting with sponge-like porous materials. 
   (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3450626.3459764)
   3. Lagrangian Neural Style Transfer for Fluids (SIGGRAPH 2020) - A neural style transfer approach from images to 3D fluids formulated in a
Lagrangian viewpoint.
