# CS775 Project Ideas
Project ideas for the advanced computer graphics course

## Physics-based animation

1. Kitchen physics - simulate the physics and process of cooking. How to simulate a chapati rising, or simple dal-rice?
  - Anyone can cook (http://graphics.pixar.com/library/AnyoneCanCook/paper.pdf)
  - Non-newtonian fluids (http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2015-01.pdf)
  
2. Detailed cloth simulation from data - take the help of data to produce detailed cloth sims. Can data help with collisions too?
  - Subspace clothing (http://graphics.pixar.com/library/SubspaceClothing/paper.pdf)
  - Data-driven clothing (http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2018-03.pdf)

3. Interactive clay sculpture
  - Model a character in clay, virtually (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbxuFZhvl9o)
  
4. Learning automatic character controllers from video - look at a person walk and replicate the walk on a character
  - Physics based locomotion for characters (https://www.goatstream.com/research/thesis/index.html)
 
## Art
1. Can your algorithm paint like Rembrandt? How about Raja Ravi Verma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Ravi_Varma)?

2. Simulating painting
  - Wetbrush: GPU-based 3D painting simulation at the bristle level (http://www.zhilichen.com/projects/#wetbrush-pub)
