# CS775 Project Ideas
Project ideas for the advanced computer graphics course

## Physics-based animation

1. Kitchen physics - simulate the physics and process of cooking. How to simulate a chapati rising, or simple dal-rice?
   1. Anyone can cook (http://graphics.pixar.com/library/AnyoneCanCook/paper.pdf)
   2. Non-newtonian fluids (http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2015-01.pdf)
  
2. Detailed cloth simulation from data - take the help of data to produce detailed cloth sims. Can data help with collisions too?
   1. Subspace clothing (http://graphics.pixar.com/library/SubspaceClothing/paper.pdf)
   2. Data-driven clothing (http://physbam.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/papers/stanford2018-03.pdf)
   
3. Interactive clay sculpture
   1. Model a character in clay, virtually (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbxuFZhvl9o)
  
4. Learning automatic character controllers from video - look at a person walk and replicate the walk on a character
   1. Physics based locomotion for characters (https://www.goatstream.com/research/thesis/index.html)
 
  
## Art

1. Can your algorithm paint like Rembrandt? How about Raja Ravi Verma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Ravi_Varma)?
   1. https://www.nextrembrandt.com/
  
2. Simulating painting
   1. Wetbrush: GPU-based 3D painting simulation at the bristle level (http://www.zhilichen.com/projects/#wetbrush-pub)
   
3. Auto generating Motion Comics
   1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_comic


## Augmented Reality

1. Create your own version of augmented reality treasure hunt on campus - clues can be a mix of real and virtual 
   1. Get inspired by the AR gaming sensation: Pokemon Go (https://www.pokemongo.com/en-us/)
  
  
## Character Animation

1. Learning by mimicing - DeepMimic

## Rendering

1. Deep Shading: Convolutional Neural Networks for Screen-Space Shading
   1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06078.pdf
2. Render for CNN Viewpoint estimation
   1. https://shapenet.cs.stanford.edu/projects/RenderForCNN/
3. Realistic rendering of human skin
